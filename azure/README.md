# Azure Cloud 

As part of this learning exercise it makes sense to install and configure a Azure IoT Hub and Edge devices to make provisioning easier through a managed service.

This is not a required item but as a way to learn Azure IoT this application makes sense and the free tier of 8000 messages per day should be sufficent. 

## Azure IoT 

Azure IoT Edge is a fully managed service that allows devices to securely communicate to deploy Cloud workloads to run on Internet of Things (IoT) Edge devices using standard containers.  This system allows for secure communications with our systems that is managed by Azure so we do not have to deal with security key rotation, secure communications channels, fault tolerance, and many other aspects with running code on edge computing systems.

## Azure IoT Hub

The Azure Hub is the centrally managed server that support various device management and data exchanges necessary.  This is where devices are created and managed.

## Azure IoT Edge

This is the deice that is at the edge and deployed out in the field running our workloads.
